These are a few things I am reading this semester:
<ul>
	<li> Fourier Analysis in Groups and Applications: Audrey Terras
	<li> Pseudorandomness Monograph by Vadhan
	<li> Papers pertaining to my research interests
	
</ul>

Now for a bit of non-academic reading:
<ul>
	<li> Last Night At the Telegraph Club by Malinda Lo
	<li> Road to Reality by Roger Penrose (this is going on at a super slow pace)
</ul>

Please feel free to reach out in case you're reading the same things and(/or) are interested in talking about them.
