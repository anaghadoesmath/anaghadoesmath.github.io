<p> I intend to maintain this both as an academic website as well as my personal website. In my free time, I like watching movies (particularly documentaries) and listening to music. I am also partial to good <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosa_(food)">dosas</a>
</p>

<p> You can check out what I am reading currently <a href = "reading.html"> here </a>. I am also a huge history buff, I am planning on recording some of my visits in a blog. I am also very interested in Tamil History and literature: particularly those pertaining to the Bhakti Movement. Stay tuned for more!
