title: About me

<p>
Hello there! I am Anagha, and I am a first year PhD student in the Computer Science department at Khoury College, Northeastern University.  I am a part of the <a href = "https://theory.khoury.northeastern.edu/index.html">Theory Group </a>. 
</p>

<p> I am primarily interested in theoretical computer science, mostly computational complexity and pseudorandomness. I like using algebraic techniques to approach any problem. </p>

<p> I also co-organize the <a href = "https://theory.khoury.northeastern.edu/seminar.html"> Khoury Theory Seminar </a>.
