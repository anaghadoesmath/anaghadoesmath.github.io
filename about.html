title: About me
---

<p>
Hello there! I am Anagha, and I am a fourth year undergraduate at BITS Pilani Hyderabad majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am broadly interested in all flavors of theory, but
particularly in problems with an algebraic tinge to them. You can read more about my research interests <a href= "./interests">here</a>
</p>
<p>
These are a few <a href = "./notes"> notes</a> that I have made as a part of coursework (or just because).<br> You can find a copy of my CV<a href = "./cv.pdf"> here </a>. 
</p>

<p>
You should find everything else in the sidebar. Feel free to contact me at anagha[dot]g[dot]math[at]gmail[dot]com (phew, that was a mouthful).<br>
PS: Idea for website layout shamelessly inspired by <a href = "https://amitrajaraman.github.io/"> Amit's. </a>.
