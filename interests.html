title: Research Interests
---

<p> I have a very broad interest in computational complexity theory. I am interested in all things algebraic, and try to look at things around me from an algebraic perspective. I also like to see the interplay of different techniques, and in particular how <a href = "https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2016/05/18/a-symmetric-formulation-of-the-croot-lev-pach-ellenberg-gijswijt-capset-bound/">unusual techniques can help solve the problem at hand </a>. Below is a very broad list of the areas I am excited about. These aren't necessarily areas I am currently working on, but there are problems in these areas that I find interesting and would like to work on some day. </p>

<ol>
	<li> Algebraic Hardness vs Randomness
	<li> Expansion: Groups, High Dimensional expanders, etc <sup><a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">1</a>.</sup>
	<li> Complexity Theoretic work in Algorithmic Fairness and Learning Theory <sup><a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">1</a>.</sup>
	<li> Additive Combiantorics: Plenty of work surrounding Szemeredi's Theorem
</ol>

In the past, I have worked on algebraic complexity theory and some problems in tensors. 

<p> <id="footnote-1">1. If you are in the greater Boston area and interested in these topics, feel free to reach. I want to set up a small-ish reading group where we can read, present and explain concepts to each other.</p>
