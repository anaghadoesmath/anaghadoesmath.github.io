<p>
For the most part, I study (algebraic) complexity theory. I am interested in all things algebraic, and try to look at things around me from an algebraic perspective.
Currently, I am trying to learn things in <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_complexity_theory">Geometric Complexity Theory </a>. My broad interests are in computational complexity theory. I am trying to learn more about pseudorandomness, particularly about expanders and pseudorandom generators. I find derandomization absolutely magical.

In the past, I have worked in 
<ul>
	<li> Mathematics of Machine Learning/Statistical learning Theory: Dimensionality Reduction, Learning on Non-Euclidean Spaces; Machine Learning Techniques for computational algebraic geometric algorithms. I hope to revisit these topics one day.
	<li> Isogeny based Techniques for Post Quantum Cryptography
	<li> Topics in logic and constructive mathematics
</ul>

My ultimate aim would be to marry a few of these ideas together.
